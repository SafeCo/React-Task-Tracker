# React-Task-Tracker
## Description
A task tracker made in react.

## How to use
Click on the green 'Add' button on the top right hand corner to Add a new task.

Enter the task, date, time and set a reminder, once completed click 'save task'.

A reminder can be set on the task, alternatively a reminder can be set by double clicking on the task once the task had been saved.

Delete a task by clicking on the red X button that appears on the top right hand corner of the saved task.

## What I learnt
This was my first project in React, from the project I learnt about the virtual DOM and JSX.

I also learnt how to create functional components with the useState hook.
